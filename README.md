# Password_Generator

## Description

When someone wants to secure any sensitive data, a strong and distinct password will protect their information from potential hackers. The purpose of a password generator is to create such distinct password based of certain criteria a user can pick out. 

This specific password generator has a simple title and a message box that will display the final password outcome based of the characters a user chose from. There is a button labeled "Generate Password" that must be clicked which will first prompt up a screen asking how the preferred password length the user would like. Next, new prompt screens will pop up asking whether the user would want upper case and/or lower case characters, numbers, or special characters in the final password. A strong, random password will continue to be created after finishing the prompts.

To format the password generator, Visual Studio Code is utilized and the final outcome is pushed to GitHub in order to access the folder online. 

## Installation

In order to start creating a more accessible website, downloading Visual Studio Code is necessary. Simply go to their website at [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

Follow the steps to download on Windows or Mac. Once the program is downloaded, transfer the Develop file from the UCF FT Coding Boot Camp repository.

Work from the index.html and css tabs to start condensing the code for better accessibility.

## Usage

Visual Studio Code was used to edit a pre-existing code. The once the prompts asked are answered, a random and strong password is created.
